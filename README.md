# metis

A Clojure library for statistics.

## Usage

Use descriptive namespace for common functions such as mean, median, quartiles, variance and standard deviation.

Later there should be a Server and Client providing these functions and much much more. ;-)

## Fire up repls

Start two REPLs: in the first start the jetty-server in clj/metis/server/routes.clj, in the other the piggyback REPL from cljs/metis/client.cljs.
