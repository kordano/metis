# metis

A Clojure service for statistics.

## Usage

Use descriptive namespace for common functions such as mean, median, quartiles, variance and standard deviation.

Later there should be a Server and Client providing these functions and much much more. ;-)

## Fire up repls

Build the ClojureScript find and start two REPLs: in the first start the jetty-server in routes.clj, in the other the piggyback REPL from client.cljs.
